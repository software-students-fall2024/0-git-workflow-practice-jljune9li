# [AI is shaping the fate of software engineers, but there is a new way to succeed](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/24/ai-shaping-fate-of-software-engineers-but-there-is-new-way-to-succeed.html)
  I think what's interesting about this article is that it addresses a key concern for
  entry-level software engineers who are new to the field and may feel overwhelmed by the
  rapid development of AI. Many people fear that AI will take over most software engineers's jobs. 
  However, software engineering is not just about coding. As Winston Tang, the founder of the online
  programming education platform LeetCode, explains, “It’s engineering end-to-end solutions,"
  and "Coding is just one small part of that solution." I believe that while entry-level engineers may face challenges
  as AI takes over simpler coding tasks,  cognitive skills like logical reasoning and business insight
  will help engineers remain relevant and thrive in this new landscape.
  This shift means us engineers will need stronger problem-solving skills,a deeper understanding of end-to-end solutions,
  and the ability to collaborate effectively with non-technical stakeholders.
